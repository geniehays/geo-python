Figure 2.2 breaks down the different parts of the string. The text that you want to create and/or modify is enclosed within the quotes preceded with letter `f`. You can pass any existing variable inside the text template by placing the name of the variable within the curly braces `{}`. Using string formatting, it is also possible to insert numbers (such as `station_id` and `temp`) within the body of text without needing first to convert the data types to strings. This is because the f-string functionality kindly does the data type conversion for us in the background without us needing to worry about it (handy!). \n",

The format specifier works by first adding a colon (`:`) after the variable name, and then specifying with dot (`.`) that we want to round our value to 2 decimal places (can be any number of digits). The final character `f` in the format specifier defines the type of the formatting that will be done: the character `f` will display the value as a decimal number, the character `e` would make the number appear in scientific notation, while the character `%` would convert the value to percentage representation. \n",
